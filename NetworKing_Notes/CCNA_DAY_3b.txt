Notes from Free CCNA | Day 3 part 2: Subnetting class C IP

Subnetting is easy and can be done mentally

Subnetting is breaking down a large network, like putting walls up in a large room.

Private IP are addresses in the ranges:
Class A 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 		16,777,216 	addresses
Class B 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255	1,048,576	addresses
Class C 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255. 65,536		addresses

Private IP addresses can only travel in the local network, not over the internet.
Computers in the local LAN will all receive a private IP

There are 4.2 billion IP addresses in IPv4, which is not enough for all devices on the internet.
So each computer in the current internet does not have a unique internet facing IP address.

CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing /24+

IP		192.168.100.225
Subnet	255.255.255.0


Example 1: To break the network into 2, borrow 1 bit from the host part of the subnet.
	IP		192.168.100.225                              |<-new host position
	Subnet	255.255.255.128 (11111111.11111111.11111111.10000000)

	Network ID 1	192.168.100.0
	Broadcast ID 1	192.168.100.127

	Network ID 2	192.168.100.128
	Broadcast ID 2	192.168.100.255

Example 2: To break the network into 4, borrow 2 bits from the host part of the subnet.
	IP		192.168.100.225                               |<-new host position
	Subnet	255.255.255.192 (11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000)

	Network ID 1	192.168.100.0
	Broadcast ID 1	192.168.100.63

	Network ID 2	192.168.100.64
	Broadcast ID 2	192.168.100.127

	Network ID 3	192.168.100.128
	Broadcast ID 3	192.168.100.191

	Network ID 4	192.168.100.192
	Broadcast ID 4	192.168.100.255

Borrowed Bits	|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|	6	|
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Mask Value		|	128	|	192	|	224	|	240	|	248	|	252	|
Subnets			|	2	|	4	|	8	|	16	|	32	|	64	|
Hosts			|	126	|	62	|	30	|	14	|	6	|	2	|
CIDR			|	/25	|	/26	|	/27	|	/28	|	/29	|	/30	|
Block Size		|	128	|	64	|	32	|	16	|	8	|	4	|

VLSM - 	Variable length subnet mask. Allows unequal distribution of hosts in subnet.
		Just use a different CIDR for different ranges of IP in the same network.

VLSM Example: Design a network with 3 subnets, 60, 100 and 34.
		split into 126, 62 and 62.
BLOCKSIZ|		Type		|		IP				|
----------------------------------------------------|
126:	|	Network ID:		|	192.168.1.0/25		|
		|	Broadcast ID:	|	192.168.1.127/25	|
		|					|						|
62:		|	Network ID:		|	192.168.1.128/26	|
		|	Broadcast ID:	|	192.168.1.191/26	|
		|					|						|
62:		|	Network ID:		|	192.168.1.192/26	|
		|	Broadcast ID:	|	192.168.1.255/26	|
