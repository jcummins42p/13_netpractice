CCNA - Cisco Certified Network Associate
From YouTube Channel: NetworKing
Subnetting notes from Free CCNA | Day 1: Network Fundamentals

CCNA Valuable certification that covers a broad variety of netweorking fundamentals:
> Network Fundamentals (IPv4/IPv6, routing, switching)
> Network Access (VLANs, Access Control)
> IP Connectivity (Routing protocols like OSPF)
> IP Services (NAT, DHCP, QoS)
> Security Fundamentals (Basic security concepts)

the 200-301 is the updated, consolidated exam.

200 prefix indicates it's an associate-level exam. (entry, associate, professional, expert)
301 suffix indicates the subject area.

What is a network?
	To communicate between computers, even if they run of different OSes, because of the common language of networking.

The basics:
	ETHERNET:two computers connected by a wire with an RJ45 connector

But if you have more than 2 computers, it makes sense to connect everything to a central networking device called a SWITCH. This also allows network users to share resources and devices such as printers.

One network in an office is a LAN - local area network.

Connecting multiple LANs we can use the internet via ISPs to create a WAN (wide area network)

Internet is nothing but a massive WAN:
	"a global computer network providing a variety of information and communication facilities consisting of interconnected networks using standardized communication protocols."

3 Critical factors: speed, delay and availability.

Data throughput over the internet will always depend on the speed of the slowest link in the path of routers between you and the server.

Sending data over a long distance you will have a long delay in communication so internet routing favours nearby servers. Also there is more likelihood of links being down over long routes, so availability is better to nearby servers.

3 Network topologies: RING, STAR, BUS

In the real world we use HYBRID networks, since local areas are mostly star around a router.
