Subnetting notes from Free CCNA | Day 3: IPv4

IPv4 looks like 192.10.10.2
IPv6 looks like 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

IP is a conectionless protocol and operates at layer 3 connection layer.

IPv4 is dotted decimal representation of four octets (0-255)

which are represented in decimal, but obviously stored as binary like
	11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000
4 x 8 bit = IP addresses are 32 bit numbers.

IP Address:
Subnet Mask:
Gateway:

Every IP has a network and a host field. The subnet mask indicates which part is which:
For each field in the subnet which is 255, the corresponding field in the IP is network.
For each field in the subnet which is 0, the corresponding field in the IP is host.
If an IP address is not part of the same network, iit will have different network fields.
IP address and gateway NEED to be in the same network.

IP CLASSES: Decided by the first octet:
> 1-126		= class A
> 127 		= LOOPBACK
> 128-191	= class B
> 192-223	= class C
> 224-239	= class D	multicast
> 240-255	= class E	experimental

Commonly we use only classes A to C for this qualification.
When the host is 0, it is the NETWORK ID
When the host is 255, it is the BROADCAST ID

So valid host ids range from 1 to 254

The gateway must share a network address (the first octets marked 255 by the subnet mask)

CLASS C Example: Class C will always have subnet mask 255.255.255.0
	IP			192.168.100.225
	Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0
	Gateway		192.168.100.1 (anything with same network)

	Network ID	192.168.100.0
	Broadcast	192.168.100.255

	Valid ip	192.168.100.1 - 192.168.100.255


CLASS B Example: Class B will always have a subnet mask 255.255.0.0
	IP			172.123.100.225
	Subnet Mask	255.255.0.0
	Gateway		172.123.1.225 (anything with same network)

	Network ID	172.123.0.0
	Broadcast	172.123.255.255

	Valid IP	172.123.0.1	to 172.123.255.254

Class A Example: will always have subnet mask 255.0.0.0
	IP			100.228.111.225
	Subnet Mask	255.0.0.0
	Gateway		100.101.123.1 (anything with same network)

	NEtwork ID	100.0.0.0
	Broadcast	100.255.255.255
	Valid IP	100.0.0.1 to 100.255.255.254
	Broadcast	100.255.255.255
